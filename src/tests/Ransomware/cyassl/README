*** Note, Please read ***

CyaSSL takes a different approach to certificate verification than OpenSSL does.The default policy for the client is to verify the server, this means that if
you don't load CAs to verify the server you'll get a connect error, unable to 
verify.  It you want to mimic OpenSSL behavior of having SSL_connect succeed
even if verifying the server fails and reducing security you can do this by
calling:

SSL_CTX_set_verify(ctx, SSL_VERIFY_NONE, 0);

before calling SSL_new();  Though it's not recommended.

CyaSSL Release 1.0.2 (4/3/2009)

Release 1.0.2 for CyaSSL adds bug fixes for a couple I/O issues.  Some systems
will send a SIGPIPE on socket recv() at any time and this should be handled by
the application by turning off SIGPIPE through setsockopt() or returning from
the handler.

Release 1.0.2 includes an alpha release of DTLS for both client and servers.
This is only for testing purposes at this time.  Rebroadcast and reordering
aren't fully implemented at this time but will be for the next release.

For general build instructions see rc1 below.

*****************CyaSSL Release Candidiate 3 rc3-1.0.0 (2/25/2009)


Release Candidate 3 for CyaSSL 1.0.0 adds bug fixes and adds a project file for
iPhone development with Xcode.  cyassl-iphone.xcodeproj is located in the root
directory.  This release also includes a fix for supporting other
implementations that bundle mulitple messages at the record layer, this was
lost when cyassl i/o was re-implemented but is now fixed.

For general build instructions see rc1 below.

*****************CyaSSL Release Candidiate 2 rc2-1.0.0 (1/21/2009)


Release Candidate 2 for CyaSSL 1.0.0 adds bug fixes and adds two new stream
ciphers along with their respective cipher suites.  CyaSSL adds support for
HC-128 and RABBIT stream ciphers.  The new suites are:

TLS_RSA_WITH_HC_128_CBC_SHA
TLS_RSA_WITH_RABBIT_CBC_SHA

And the corresponding cipher names are

HC128-SHA
RABBIT-SHA

CyaSSL also adds support for building with devkitPro for PPC by changing the
library proper to use libogc.  The examples haven't been changed yet but if
there's interest they can be.  Here's an example ./configure to build CyaSSL
for devkitPro:

./configure --disable-shared CC=/pathTo/devkitpro/devkitPPC/bin/powerpc-gekko-gcc --host=ppc --without-zlib --enable-singleThreaded RANLIB=/pathTo/devkitpro/devkitPPC/bin/powerpc-gekko-ranlib CFLAGS="-DDEVKITPRO -DGEKKO"

For linking purposes you'll need

LDFLAGS="-g -mrvl -mcpu=750 -meabi -mhard-float -Wl,-Map,$(notdir $@).map"

For general build instructions see rc1 below.


********************CyaSSL Release Candidiate 1 rc1-1.0.0 (12/17/2008)


Release Candidate 1 for CyaSSL 1.0.0 contains major internal changes.  Several
areas have optimization improvements, less dynamic memory use, and the I/O
strategy has been refactored to allow alternate I/O handling or Library use.
Many thanks to Thierry Fournier for providing these ideas and most of the work.

Because of these changes, this release is only a candidate since some problems
are probably inevitable on some platform with some I/O use.  Please report any
problems and we'll try to resolve them as soon as possible.  You can contact us
at support@yassl.com or todd@yassl.com.

Using TomsFastMath by passing --enable-fastmath to ./configure now uses assemblyon some platforms.  This is new so please report any problems as every compiler,mode, OS combination hasn't been tested.  On ia32 all of the registers need to
be available so be sure to pass these options to CFLAGS:

CFLAGS="-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer"

OS X will also need -mdynamic-no-pic added to CFLAGS

Also if you're building in shared mode for ia32 you'll need to pass options to
LDFLAGS as well on OS X:

LDFLAGS=-Wl,-read_only_relocs,warning

This gives warnings for some symblos but seems to work.


--To build on Linux, Solaris, *BSD, Mac OS X, or Cygwin:

    ./configure
    make

    from the ./testsuite/ directory run ./testsuite 

to make a debug build:

    ./configure --enable-debug --disable-shared
    make



--To build on Win32

Choose (Re)Build All from the project workspace

Run the testsuite program





*************************CyaSSL version 0.9.9 (7/25/2008) 

This release of CyaSSL adds bug fixes, Pre-Shared Keys, over-rideable memory
handling, and optionally TomsFastMath.  Thanks to Moisés Guimarães for the
work on TomsFastMath.

To optionally use TomsFastMath pass --enable-fastmath to ./configure
Or define USE_FAST_MATH in each project from CyaSSL for MSVC.

Please use the benchmark routine before and after to see the performance
difference, on some platforms the gains will be little but RSA encryption
always seems to be faster.  On x86-64 machines with GCC the normal math library
may outpreform the fast one when using CFLAGS=-m64 becuase TomsFastMath can't
yet use -m64 because of GCCs inability to do 128bit division.

     **** UPDATE GCC 4.2.1 can now do 128bit division ***

See notes below (0.2.0) for complete build instructions.


****************CyaSSL version 0.9.8 (5/7/2008) 

This release of CyaSSL adds bug fixes, client side Diffie-Hellman, and better
socket handling.

See notes below (0.2.0) for complete build instructions.


****************CyaSSL version 0.9.6 (1/31/2008) 

This release of CyaSSL adds bug fixes, increased session management, and a fix
for gnutls.

See notes below (0.2.0) for complete build instructions.


****************CyaSSL version 0.9.0 (10/15/2007) 

This release of CyaSSL adds bug fixes, MSVC 2005 support, GCC 4.2 support, 
IPV6 support and test, and new test certificates.

See notes below (0.2.0) for complete build instructions.


****************CyaSSL version 0.8.0 (1/10/2007) 

This release of CyaSSL adds increased socket support, for non-blocking writes,
connects, and interrupted system calls.

See notes below (0.2.0) for complete build instructions.


****************CyaSSL version 0.6.3 (10/30/2006) 

This release of CyaSSL adds debug logging to stderr to aid in the debugging of
CyaSSL on systems that may not provide the best support.

If CyaSSL is built with debugging support then you need to call
CyaSSL_Debugging_ON() to turn logging on.

On Unix use ./configure --enable-debug

On Windows define DEBUG_CYASSL when building CyaSSL


To turn logging back off call CyaSSL_Debugging_OFF()

See notes below (0.2.0) for complete build instructions.


*****************CyaSSL version 0.6.2 (10/29/2006) 

This release of CyaSSL adds TLS 1.1.

Note that CyaSSL has certificate verification on by default, unlike OpenSSL.
To emulate OpenSSL behavior, you must call SSL_CTX_set_verify() with
SSL_VERIFY_NONE.  In order to have full security you should never do this, 
provide CyaSSL with the proper certificates to elimante imposters and call
CyaSSL_check_domain_name() to prevent man in the middle attacks.

See notes below (0.2.0) for build instructions.

*****************CyaSSL version 0.6.0 (10/25/2006) 

This release of CyaSSL adds more SSL functions, better autoconf, nonblocking
I/O for accept, connect, and read.  There is now an --enable-small configure
option that turns off TLS, AES, DES3, HMAC, and ERROR_STRINGS, see configure.in
for the defines.  Note that TLS requires HMAC and AES requires TLS.

See notes below (0.2.0) for build instructions.


*****************CyaSSL version 0.5.5 (09/27/2006) 

This mini release of CyaSSL adds better input processing through buffered input
and big message support.  Added SSL_pending() and some sanity checks on user
settings.

See notes below (0.2.0) for build instructions.


*****************CyaSSL version 0.5.0 (03/27/2006) 

This release of CyaSSL adds AES support and minor bug fixes. 

See notes below (0.2.0) for build instructions.


*****************CyaSSL version 0.4.0 (03/15/2006)

This release of CyaSSL adds TLSv1 client/server support and libtool. 

See notes below for build instructions.


*****************CyaSSL version 0.3.0 (02/26/2006)

This release of CyaSSL adds SSLv3 server support and session resumption. 

See notes below for build instructions.


*****************CyaSSL version 0.2.0 (02/19/2006)


This is the first release of CyaSSL and its crypt brother, CTaoCrypt.  CyaSSL
is written in ANSI C with the idea of a small code size, footprint, and memory
usage in mind.  CTaoCrypt can be as small as 32K, and the current client
version of CyaSSL can be as small as 12K.


The first release of CTaoCrypt supports MD5, SHA-1, 3DES, ARC4, Big Integer
Support, RSA, ASN parsing, and basic x509 (en/de)coding.

The first release of CyaSSL supports normal client RSA mode SSLv3 connections
with support for SHA-1 and MD5 digests.  Ciphers include 3DES and RC4.
